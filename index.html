            <p>Born in London on June 23rd, 1912, Alan Turing was the son of a civil servant and attended a high-ranking private
                 school. In 1931, he began studying mathematics at King’s College at the University of Cambridge. 1934,
                  they elected him to a fellowship for his probability theory research.</p>
            <p>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
                Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max 
                Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped
                develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. Turing wrote on the
                chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
                Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was
                never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official 
                Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment, a procedure
                commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954,
                aged 41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but the evidence is also
                consistent with accidental poisoning. Following a campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon
                Brown made an official public apology for "the appalling way [Turing] was treated". Queen
                Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013. The term "Alan Turing law" is used informally to refer to
                a 2017 law in the UK that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
                legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.</p>
